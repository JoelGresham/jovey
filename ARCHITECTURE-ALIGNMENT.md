# Architecture Alignment Analysis
## Comparing Original Vision vs. Current Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Gap Analysis Complete

---

## Executive Summary

We've built **85% of a fully functional e-commerce platform**, but it currently operates as a **traditional CRUD application** rather than the **AI-native event-sourced system** described in the original architecture documents.

### What We Built (Current State)
✅ **Standard E-Commerce Platform:**
- Complete product catalog with SKU management
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Order management system
- Multi-tier authentication (consumer, dealer, staff)
- Staff operations portal
- B2B dealer capabilities
- Image upload and storage
- Full CRUD operations

### What Was Planned (Original Vision)
📋 **AI-Native Business Operating System:**
- Event-sourced data model (agents post events, not direct writes)
- AI agents for each business function
- Agent-to-agent communication network
- Database Manager translating events to state
- Graduated autonomy (human approval → automation)
- Real-time agent communication
- Event audit trail

### The Gap
We have a **solid e-commerce foundation** that works well for traditional operations, but we haven't implemented the **AI-native layer** that was the core innovation of the original vision.
