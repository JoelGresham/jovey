# AI-Native Business Architecture
## Briefing Document v0.1

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for an AI-native manufacturing and e-commerce business designed to be automated from inception while maintaining human oversight and control. The system is built as a single web application serving as the complete operating system for the business, with modular functional pages, AI agents, and flexible human-AI collaboration.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Integrated Platform
- All business operations occur within one web application
- Unified infrastructure eliminates traditional tech stack sprawl (no separate ERP, CRM, PLM systems)
- Multiple access tiers: consumers, dealers/retailers, staff

### 2. Function-Based Architecture
- Each business function has its own page serving as dashboard and control center
- Pages display current state, metrics, decisions, events, and inter-agent communications
- Functions can be operated by humans, AI agents, or collaboratively

### 3. AI Agent Network
- Each function has an associated AI agent
- Agents communicate peer-to-peer (no central orchestrator initially)
- Network effects: productivity increases as more agents/nodes are added
- All decisions tracked on functional pages with clear attribution

### 4. Event-Sourced Data Model
- Agents post events describing what happened (not direct database writes)
- Database derives current state from event stream
- Creates natural audit trail and prevents data conflicts
- Agents can read all data but post events rather than writing directly

### 5. Incremental Capability Building
- Start simple, expand systematically
- All decisions require human approval initially
- Restrictions removed gradually as confidence builds
- Clear documentation of architecture and next steps

### 6. Hybrid Interface Model
- Functional pages serve both humans and AI from same data source
- Humans see visual page design (HTML/CSS)
- AI agents consume structured data (JSON/API)
- Both views derived from identical underlying data

---

## System Components

### Access Tiers

#### 1. Consumer/End User Access
- Direct purchasing through website
- Order tracking and history
- Standard pricing
- Account management

#### 2. Dealer/Retailer Portal (B2B)
- Account-specific pricing (volume discounts, promotional pricing)
- Bulk ordering capabilities
- Order history and tracking
- Access to marketing materials and product information

#### 3. Staff Access
- Function-specific pages based on role
- Decision approval interfaces
- Inter-function communication visibility
- System oversight and control

## Data Architecture

### Database Structure
- Single unified database
- All agents can READ all data
- Agents POST events (they don't write directly to database)
- Database Manager translates events into database transactions
- Event-sourced model creates audit trail

### Data Ownership by Function

| Data Type | Owned By | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Product Designs | NPD | Design phase |
| Bill of Materials | NPD | Design phase |
| Bill of Process | NPI | Production phase |
| Raw Materials Inventory | Procurement | Supplies Production |
| Finished Goods Inventory Targets | Forecasting | Sets stock levels |
| Actual Finished Goods Inventory | Fulfillment | Physical tracking |
| Product Catalog & Listings | Category | Customer-facing |
| Base Pricing | Category | Long-term strategic |
| Promotional Pricing | Promotions | Short-term tactical |
| Customer Data | Customer Management | All customer types |
| Order Data | Multiple | Flows through functions |
| Quality Data | Quality | Cross-functional visibility |
| Financial Data | AR/AP/Budget | Specialized by type |

### Event Flow Examples

**Example 1: Customer Places Order**
1. Customer places order on website
2. Order system posts event: "Order #123 placed by Customer X for 10 units Product Y"
3. Database Manager creates order record
4. AR reads order, posts event: "Invoice #456 generated for Order #123"
5. Fulfillment reads order, posts event: "Order #123 picked and packed"
6. Fulfillment posts event: "Order #123 shipped, inventory reduced by 10 units Product Y"
7. Forecasting reads inventory update, adjusts forecasts

**Example 2: Production Run**
1. Forecasting AI determines need for more Product Y
2. Production AI reads forecast and current inventory
3. Production AI messages Procurement AI: "Need materials for 100 units Product Y"
4. Procurement AI confirms material availability
5. Production posts event: "Production run started: 100 units Product Y"
6. Production posts event: "Materials pulled: Components A, B, C"
7. Production posts event: "Production run completed: 100 units Product Y"
8. Fulfillment receives finished goods

**Example 3: Quality Issue Escalation**
1. Quality AI detects issue with component from Supplier X
2. Quality posts event: "Non-conformance raised: Supplier X, Component Y"
3. Quality AI messages Procurement AI about supplier issue
4. Procurement AI reviews supplier history
5. Human in Procurement approves corrective action
6. Procurement posts event: "Corrective action requested from Supplier X"

---

## Agent Communication Patterns

### Peer-to-Peer Communication
Agents communicate directly with each other when collaboration is needed:

**Pattern:**
1. Agent A queries database for relevant data
2. Agent A messages Agent B: "I see [situation], should we [proposed action]?"
3. Agent B reviews context and responds
4. If consensus: Agent A posts decision event (pending human approval)
5. If conflict: Escalate to relevant humans for decision

**Example:**
- Production AI pulls sales orders from database
- Production AI messages Sales: "I see 200 units ordered for next week, but we're low on raw materials. Should we prioritize these orders or wait for material delivery?"
- Customer Management AI responds with customer priority information
- Production AI messages Procurement AI about material urgency
- Decision made (with human approval initially)

### Decision Tracking
All decisions logged on relevant functional pages:
- Decision description
- Agents involved
- Data considered
- Human approval (initially required for all decisions)
- Outcome and impact

---

## Human-AI Collaboration Model

### Phase 1: Human Approval Required (Launch State)
- All agent decisions require human final approval
- Agents can gather data, analyze, recommend
- Humans review and approve/reject on functional pages
- System learns from human decisions

### Phase 2: Graduated Autonomy
- Low-risk decisions automated (e.g., routine reordering)
- Medium-risk decisions require approval
- High-risk decisions always require approval
- Clear thresholds documented per function

### Phase 3: Full Autonomy with Oversight
- Most operational decisions automated
- Humans focus on strategic decisions and exceptions
- Audit and monitoring of agent decisions
- Ability to override or adjust at any time

---

## Integration Points

### External Systems (Minimal, as needed)
The system should remain self-contained, but may integrate with:

- **Microsoft Teams**: For meetings, project collaboration
  - Integration: Calendar sync, meeting notes feed to relevant functional pages

- **Shipping Carriers**: For fulfillment
  - Integration: API connections for shipping labels, tracking

- **Payment Processors**: For customer payments
  - Integration: Payment gateway for website, portal

- **Accounting Software** (Optional): If needed for compliance
  - Integration: Export financial data from Budget/FP&A

### Integration Principles
- Data from external systems should be displayed on relevant functional pages
- Clear documentation of what data flows in/out
- Avoid creating dependencies on external systems where possible
- Build internal capability first, integrate only when necessary

---

## Technical Considerations (High-Level)

### Platform Architecture
- Single web application framework (specific technology TBD)
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop access
- Database: SQL or NoSQL (TBD based on event-sourcing requirements)
- API layer serving structured data to both frontend and AI agents
- Authentication and role-based access control

### AI Agent Implementation
- Natural language processing for inter-agent communication
- Access to Claude API or similar for decision-making
- Event posting capability to database
- Query capability to read database
- Message passing between agents

### Scalability Approach
- Start with minimal viable functions
- Add functions/pages/agents incrementally
- Document each addition clearly
- Test integration with existing functions before going live
- Monitor performance and optimize as needed
